MLflow Classification Pipeline
English

This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline using MLflow for automation and tracking of model metrics in a classification problem.
It focuses on Decision Tree and Random Forest models, including handling of imbalanced datasets using SMOTE oversampling.

Features

Data preprocessing: Handles dataset balancing and conversion to DataFrame.

Model training: Trains Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers.

Metric tracking: Logs accuracy, F1-score, and other metrics to MLflow.

Model tracking: Saves trained models as MLflow artifacts.

Visualization: Plots confusion matrix with percentages and Decision Tree structure.

MLflow is used to monitor experiments, compare models, and store both metrics and models in a reproducible way.
The project is suitable as a template for classification tasks requiring experiment tracking and visualization.
